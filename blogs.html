                    <p>1. Soccer (Football)
                        Soccer is played between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net using any part of the body except the hands and arms. Players can pass, dribble, and shoot the ball to advance it, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands within the penalty area. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.
                        
                        2. Basketball
                        Basketball is played on a rectangular court by two teams of five players each. The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted 10 feet high. Players can dribble the ball while moving, and they can pass to teammates or take shots from different distances. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.
                        
                        3. Volleyball
                        Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball over the net and landing it in the opponent's court while preventing them from returning it. Each team is allowed three touches to return the ball over the net, and players rotate positions after winning a serve. A match is typically played in sets, with the first team to reach a designated number of points winning the set.
        
                        4. Tennis
                        Tennis can be played as a singles match (one player against another) or doubles (two players on each side). The game is played on a rectangular court divided by a net, and players aim to hit a ball over the net into the opponent's court. Points are scored when the opponent fails to return the ball within the designated court boundaries. The player or team winning the most sets wins the match.
                        
                        5. Baseball
                        Baseball is played between two teams of nine players on a diamond-shaped field. The game consists of batting and fielding, where one team bats and attempts to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the pitcher. Players run around four bases to score, while the opposing team tries to catch the ball and get batters out. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins.
                
                        6. Rugby
                        Rugby is played between two teams of 15 players on an oval field with goalposts at each end. The objective is to score points by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line or kicking it through the goalposts. Players can pass the ball laterally or backward but cannot pass it forward; they can tackle opponents to gain possession. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.
                        
                        7. Golf
                        Golf is played on a large outdoor course with a series of holes, each consisting of a teeing ground, fairway, and green with a hole. The objective is to hit a small ball into each hole in the fewest number of strokes. Players use various clubs to hit the ball, and they take turns playing from where the previous shot landed. The player with the lowest total strokes at the end of the round wins.
                        
                        8. Swimming
                        Swimming is typically performed in a pool or open water, with participants racing against each other or the clock. Swimmers use different strokes (like freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly) to propel themselves through the water. Competitions can be individual or team relays, with distances varying from short sprints to long-distance races. The swimmer who touches the wall first in their heat or final is declared the winner.
                        
                        9. Badminton
                        Badminton is played by two players in singles or four players in doubles on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to score points by hitting a shuttlecock over the net and landing it in the opponent's court. Players can use their rackets to serve and return the shuttlecock, and the rally continues until one player fails to return it or hits it out of bounds. The game is played to a set number of points, usually 21, and matches are often best of three games.
                        
                        10. Sepak Takraw
                        Sepak takraw is played by two teams of three players each on a rectangular court, similar to volleyball, but with a net. The objective is to score points by hitting a rattan ball over the net and into the opponent's court using any part of the body except the hands and arms. Players can perform various kicks, headers, and body moves to control the ball, and each team is allowed three touches to return it. Matches are played in sets, and the team that wins the most sets wins the match.
                        
                        11. Field Games (Track and Field)
                        Field games encompass a variety of athletic events, typically held in a stadium or track. These events include running races (sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance), jumps (long jump, triple jump, high jump), and throws (shot put, discus, javelin). Athletes compete individually or in relay teams, aiming to achieve the best time, distance, or height in their respective events. Points or medals are awarded based on performance, and competitions can be organized as part of larger events like the Olympics.</p>
